This project implements and compares several deep learning models for sentiment analysis, classifying text into Negative, Neutral, or Positive categories using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes a range of architectures such as a simple LSTM, stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with an attempt at a custom attention mechanism, and a Conv1D model for capturing local n-gram patterns. The models were trained on preprocessed text using tokenization, padding, and embedding layers, with optimizers like Adam and RMSprop. Techniques such as and model checkpointing were applied to improve generalization. Model performance was evaluated using categorical crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics, and visualized with training and validation accuracy plots.
